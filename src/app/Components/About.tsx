      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-7">
        I’m a frontend developer with a builder’s mindset — obsessed with shipping clean, fast, and responsive interfaces that just work. Whether it’s cloning real-world apps, crafting dashboards, or exploring bleeding-edge tools, I treat every project like a sandbox for leveling up.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 leading-7 mt-4">
        I don’t just write code — I debug, optimize, and refactor until every pixel and interaction feels right. When I'm not coding, I'm reverse-engineering great products, consuming dev content, or hacking together experiments for fun.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 leading-7 mt-4">
        My goal? Keep building, keep learning, and leave everything I touch sharper than I found it.
      </p>
